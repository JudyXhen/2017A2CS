#Computational thinking & Problem solving

1. Abstract data types: collection of data with associated operations

2. Hashing
 - Function: Calculate address from key -> go to calculated address.
 - Collision: two different key values hash to the same address
 - ways to solve collision
   ~ Chaining: creat linked list for collisions with start pointer at the hashed address.
   ~ Overflow areas: all collisions are stored in a separate overflow area. â€”> open hashing
   ~ Neighboring slots: linear search from the hashed address to find empty. -> closed hashing

3. ADT dictionary: implemented using a hash table; a value can be looked up using a direct-access method.
