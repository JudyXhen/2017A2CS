My ideas:
In this project I decided to recreate the game 2048. I didn't get used to use queues and stacks, and I don’t actually have an idea about a program that involves all these skills. Therefore, I decide to recreate a classic work, which is 2048. I used to love this game so much that I procrastinated my study, though I don’t do that anymore.
